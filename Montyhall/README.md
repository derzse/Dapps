## Monty Hall
Is an implementation of the [Monty Hall problem](http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem "Monty Hall problem")  using smart contracts on blockchain.

### Implementation
It is still not fully implemented. It allows the player for one selection between three cards (doors in the original TV show) and rewards him if he guessed the correct randomly assigned number. Next phase is to offer the player the choice of switching cards or hold on his bet.

### Instalation

To run the app one nneds to navigate to `Montyhall/dist` directory and run `index.html` in a browser. To test it Metamask is needed (on the Ropsten test net).
